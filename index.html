<h2>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
<p> HTML and CSS are the two languages used to create web pages. HTML provides the content of the web pages whereas CSS beautifies the content and all the space around it.<br>
<em> More information can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> here</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/default.asp"> here</a></em>.</p>

<b><u>HTML Elements</u></b> <br>
  The objects, or "words", used to create a web page are elements. <br>
  Elements consist of three things:
  <br>
  <li> <b>Opening tag - </b> &lt name &gt*
  <li> <b>Content - </b> Visible text
  <li> <b>Closing tag - </b> &lt /name &gt
  </li>
  <br>
  For example, writing "&ltb&gt bold &lt/b&gt" makes the word <b>bold</b>. <br>

<b><u>HTML Attributes</u></b> <br>
  To provide a link or an image on a webpage, attributes are used. <br>
  <br>
  A link in a webpage can be seen as an actionable element - the address to another webpage is embedded into the visible text, allowing users to access other webpages easily with just a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_attributes.asp"> click</a>. A link is written as follows:<br>
  "&lt a href="address to the other webpage" &gt visible text &lt /a &gt" <br>
  <em>where</em>** <br>
  a stands for link element and href means attribute name. <br>
  <br>
  A image in a webpage can be seen as the visible representation of another webpage - the address to another webpage that houses only a picture is activated to show a picture. An image is shown as follows:<br>
  "&lt img src="address to the picture webpage" alt = "error text" &gt <br>
  <em>where</em>
  img stands for image element, src means source, and alt provides a means to show an error message if the image address fails. <br>
  <br>
  <img src = "http://images.clipartpanda.com/penguin-clip-art-aiq5zAqiM.png" alt = "gone fishing">
  <br>
  <br>
  The image element differs from the link element as it doesn't have a closing tag - this is called having a void tag.
